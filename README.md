# SQL-project
This is my first sql project.

This SQL project marks the initiation into database management, focusing on the creation of a Human Resources (HR) database from scratch. 
The primary objective is to design a comprehensive database that efficiently stores and manages HR-related information, catering to the diverse needs of an organization.
